# `github.list_issues`

The "show me what's open on this repo" pack. Caller supplies `repo` and optional filters (`state`, `labels`, `assignee`); the pack GETs `/repos/{repo}/issues` with the filters and returns the GitHub issue array verbatim wrapped in `{issues: [...], count: N}`.

Stateless — no session needed. Public-repo reads work without a credential (60 req/hr unauthenticated rate limit); authenticated calls get the standard 5000 req/hr.

## Inputs

| Field | Type | Required | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `repo` | `string` | yes | — | `owner/name` slug. |
| `state` | `string` | no | `"open"` | One of `open`, `closed`, `all`. |
| `labels` | `string` | no | `""` | Comma-separated label names. AND'd — issues must have all listed labels. |
| `assignee` | `string` | no | `""` | Login of an assignee. |
| `credential` | `string` | no | `github-token` | Optional vault credential. Public reads work without it. |

## Outputs

| Field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `issues` | `array` | The GitHub issue objects verbatim. Each carries `number`, `title`, `state`, `body`, `labels[].name`, `user.login`, `assignees[]`, `created_at`, `updated_at`, `html_url`, etc. |
| `count` | `number` | `len(issues)`. Note: paginated upstream — for a repo with &gt;30 open issues, this is page 1's count, not the total. Filter or paginate via additional calls. |

> ⚠️ **Indexing latency observed at capture**: immediately after `github.create_issue` succeeds, this pack may return `count: 0` for a few minutes — GitHub's list endpoint is eventually-consistent with respect to issue creation. The created issue is fetchable directly via `gh api repos/.../issues/N` without delay.

## Vault credentials needed

**Optional.** `github-token` (PAT) raises the rate limit to 5000 req/hr and is required for private repos. Public-repo reads work without it.

## Use it from your agent (OpenClaw chat-UI worked example)

<!-- TODO(maintainer): paste an OpenClaw chat-UI transcript here.
     Prompt to use: "Use helmdeck__github-list_issues against repo \"tosin2013/helmdeck-pack-doc-fixtures\" with state=open and credential=github-token." -->

> *OpenClaw chat capture pending.*

## Developer reference (`curl`)

```bash
curl -fsS -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/v1/packs/github.list_issues \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $JWT" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "repo":       "tosin2013/helmdeck-pack-doc-fixtures",
    "state":      "open",
    "credential": "github-token"
  }'
```

Captured response (empty repo):

```json
{
  "pack": "github.list_issues",
  "version": "v1",
  "output": {
    "count":  0,
    "issues": []
  },
  "duration_ms": 372152259
}
```

## Error codes

| Code | Triggers | Captured response |
|---|---|---|
| `handler_failed` | `repo` missing | `{"error":"handler_failed","message":"repo is required"}` |
| `handler_failed` | Repo doesn't exist or PAT lacks access | `{"error":"handler_failed","message":"github API GET /repos/…/issues: 404 Not Found"}` |
| `handler_failed` | Rate-limited (60 req/hr unauthenticated) | `{"error":"handler_failed","message":"github API GET …: 403 API rate limit exceeded …"}` |

## Session chaining

**No session.** Stateless. Common chain — list, then iterate via `github.post_comment` against each one ("triage every open issue with comment X").

## Async behavior

Synchronous.
